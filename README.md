# Next.js/TypeScript: Basic User Authentication Code Sample

This TypeScript code sample demonstrates **how to implement user authentication** in Next.js web applications using Auth0. This Next.js code sample builds the web application following the App Router paradigm.

This code sample is part of the ["Auth0 Developer Resources"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources), a place where you can explore the authentication and authorization features of the Auth0 Identity Platform.

Visit the ["Next.js Authentication By Example: Using App Router"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/guides/web-app/nextjs/basic-authentication) page to learn how to implement user authentication step by step and how to integrate it with an external API server of your choice.
